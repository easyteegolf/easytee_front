Running a golf course is a complex business. You’re not just managing tee times; you’re operating a retail pro shop, running a food and beverage (F&B) service, handling memberships, and scheduling staff—all while striving to deliver a world-class guest experience.

The integration of **Easy Tee Golf** and **Square** provides a powerful platform to manage every revenue stream and drive operational efficiency at your course. Easy Tee provides the specialized booking engine your course needs, and Square offers the robust, unified commerce platform to handle everything else.

Use this guide to understand exactly how each component of Square works with your Easy Tee system to maximize efficiency.

## **1\. Tee Times: Streamlining Booking and Payment**

Your booking system is the key to your course's financial health. The integration of **Easy Tee Golf’s** specialized booking engine and tee sheet with **Square** creates a powerful system where every tee time payment is securely processed, centrally tracked, and directly connected to your money management system.

##### **Online Booking & Prepayment**

Easy Tee handles the scheduling logic (hours, pricing, cancellation windows, discounts, etc.). Square processes the payment at the time of booking or saves a card-on-file, securing your revenue immediately and reducing no-shows.

##### **Consolidated Financial Reporting**

Every payment collected via Easy Tee flows directly into your Square Dashboard's Transaction Report, allowing you to see tee time revenue alongside all other sales.

##### **Cancellation & Refund Control**

In Easy Tee, you’re in control of your cancellation policy. You choose how far in advance customers have to cancel for a full refund and how much to charge as a cancellation fee for late cancellations. You can also manually process refunds in the Square system. Regardless of where a refund is initiated, all financial records are synced to Square and are linked to the original transaction.

## **2\. Customer Data & Loyalty: Building a Unified Golfer Profile**

The key to loyalty is knowing your customer. Square automatically creates a single, unified profile for every golfer, whether they book a round or buy a drink.

##### **Unified Customer Directory**

When a customer books a tee time or pays in the Pro Shop, Square records their name and payment method, building a profile that tracks all their interactions and purchases.

##### **Targeted Pricing with Customer Groups**

Use Easy Tee or the Square Dashboard to create manual **Customer Groups**. And, leverage Square’s **Smart Groups** to automatically segment customers based on their purchase habits (e.g., 'Regulars' vs. 'Lapsed'). Both manual Customer Groups and Smart Groups can be used in Easy Tee to provide custom pricing and booking windows (e.g., members, seniors, juniors, etc.).

##### **Automated Loyalty Programs**

Easy Tee integrates with Square Loyalty Programs helping you drive repeat purchases and customer loyalty automatically every time a customer books a tee time.
