Many golf course operators are unaware that **Square is much more than just a payment processor.** It is a powerful, integrated commerce platform built to run every part of your business. Combined with Easy Tee Golf, which adds a specialized tee sheet and a powerful booking engine to the Square foundation, you get a seamless and **complete golf management solution.** Stop managing disjointed systems and discover how Easy Tee Golf and Square work together to give you the modern software solution your course deserves.

## **A Golf Course is Four Businesses in One**

A golf course is a unique operational challenge because it requires the tools of several different industries under one roof. Thanks to its power and flexibility, Square is the perfect POS system to handle them all:

#### 1. The Recreation Business (The Course)

The core of your business—the golf course itself—has unique needs for complex scheduling, dynamic pricing, and managing customer flow. **This is where Easy Tee steps in.**

* **Solution:** Easy Tee provides the specialized, powerful tee sheet and booking engine, built to integrate directly into Square's platform, ensuring tee time revenue is seamlessly recorded alongside every other sale.

#### **2. The Retail Business (The Pro Shop)**

Most golf courses rely on a pro shop, selling everything from golf balls and gloves to equipment and apparel.

* **Solution:** Square's flexible Point of Sale (POS) system handles all retail inventory and transactions with ease. Manage stock, track sales data, and process returns—all from the same system that handles your tee time payments.
