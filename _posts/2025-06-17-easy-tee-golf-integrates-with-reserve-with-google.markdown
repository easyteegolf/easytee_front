We're thrilled to announce an exciting enhancement for all Easy Tee Golf customers: a direct integration with **Reserve with Google**\! This powerful new feature is designed to make it easier than ever for golfers to find and book tee times at your course, directly from Google Search and Google Maps.

### **What does this mean for your golf course?**

Starting today, your golf course's Google business profile will be supercharged with an enhanced presence. When potential customers search for golf courses in their area on Google, they'll see a prominent "Book online" link right in your profile. This isn't just any link – it takes them *directly* to your Easy Tee Golf booking page, allowing for a seamless and efficient tee time reservation experience.

Imagine a golfer searching for a place to play. They find your course on Google Maps, see your great reviews, and with a single click, they're on your Easy Tee Golf page, ready to secure their spot. No more navigating multiple websites or trying to find your booking portal – it's all right there, at their fingertips.

**The Benefits are Clear:**

* **Increased Visibility:** Stand out in Google Search and Maps with a direct booking option.  
* **Streamlined Booking Process:** Reduce friction for your customers by connecting them directly to your booking page.  
* **Enhanced Customer Experience:** Make it incredibly easy for golfers to book tee times, leading to greater satisfaction.  
* **Drive More Bookings:** By simplifying the path to booking, you're more likely to convert searches into actual reservations.

### **Available Immediately for All Easy Tee Golf Customers\!**

The best part? This integration is **live now** for all Easy Tee Golf customers\! There's nothing you need to do to enable it; your course's Google profile will automatically reflect this exciting new capability.

### **Flexibility is Key: Opt-Out Anytime**

While we're confident this integration will be a significant benefit to your business, we also understand the importance of control. If, for any reason, you wish to opt out of the Reserve with Google integration, you can easily do so at any time. Simply navigate to your Easy Tee Golf settings page, and you'll find the option to turn off this feature.

We're constantly working to provide our customers with the best tools and features to help their businesses thrive. The Reserve with Google integration is a testament to that commitment, and we're excited to see the positive impact it will have on your bookings.
