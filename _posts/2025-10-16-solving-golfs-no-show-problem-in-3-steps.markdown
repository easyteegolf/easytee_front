The golf industry faces a persistent and costly problem: the dreaded no-show. These unfilled tee times have been estimated to cost the industry **over $1 billion per year**. While the game has seen a surge in popularity, the no-show issue has proven resilient. In a recent survey by the NGCOA, **50% of golf courses** reported that no-shows have remained steady in 2025, and a further **20%** indicated they have actually seen an *increase*.

Fortunately, success in combatting no-shows is possible. Golf courses that have successfully tackled this issue consistently find that clear **policies and rigorous enforcement** are the most effective tools for turning the tide. Here are the three essential steps to solving your no-show problem.

### **Step 1: Set Clear Policies**

The foundation of any successful strategy is a clear, concise set of rules that inform golfers of their financial responsibility when booking a tee time.

* **Set Booking and Payment Policies:** To ensure commitment, require either **prepayment** for the full round or a secure **card-on-file** to hold the reservation.  
* **Set a Cancellation Policy:** Clearly define the window for a full refund.  
  * *How far in advance* do golfers need to cancel to receive a full refund?  
  * *How much* is the fee for late cancellations (e.g., within 24 hours)?  
* **Set a No-Show Policy:** Define the financial consequence for golfers who don't show up without canceling.  
  * *What refund* (if prepaid) will be given to a no-show (if any refund at all)?  
  * *What no-show fee* (if using card-on-file) will be charged?  
* **Set a Short-Show Policy:** Address groups that show up with fewer players than booked (e.g., booking for four but only three arrive).  
  * *What fee* will be charged for the missing golfer?

### **Step 2: Implement Policy with Your Tee Sheet**

Having policies written down is not enough; they must be integrated into your booking technology for effortless enforcement.

* **Automate Cancellation Policy:** Configure your cancellation and refund deadlines **directly within your tee sheet system**. This allows the software to automatically apply the correct fee or refund based on when a customer attempts to cancel, ensuring consistency.  
* **Require Digital Agreement:** Add the full terms for your cancellation, no-show, and short-show policies to the online booking flow. Require customers to **check a box** indicating they have read and agree to these terms before they can finalize the booking.  
* **Save the Agreement Record:** Be sure your tee sheet provider saves a permanent, dated record of the customer agreeing to the terms. This digital evidence is critical if you ever need to dispute a chargeback.

### **Step 3: Enforce Your Policy Consistently**

This is where many courses fall short. Many golf courses do not enforce their policies strictly; in fact, **25% of courses** have indicated they don't enforce their policies at all. This is often due to the **fear of customer backlash**, including chargebacks (a fear perhaps justified by the fact that **86% of courses** said they almost never win chargeback disputes).

However, consistent enforcement is the only way to make the policy effective:

* **Address Communication:** Golfers surveyed indicated that policies aren't always clearly communicated. By making the customer check a box (Step 2), you've resolved this issue.  
* **Trust the Fair Charge:** The **majority of golfers** surveyed agreed that charging a no-show fee is, in fact, fair, provided the policy was clearly communicated beforehand.  
* **Choose the Preferred Method:** Interestingly, golfers often **prefer card-on-file** over full prepayment, as it feels less restrictive upon booking but still guarantees the course a way to enforce the no-show fee.  
* **Win the Chargeback:** Many golf courses indicate they have been able to **win chargeback disputes** by providing the record of the customer checking the "I agree to the terms" box as concrete evidence to their payment processor.

By setting clear policies, implementing them digitally, and enforcing them consistently, golf courses can drastically reduce no-shows, recoup lost revenue, and ensure committed golfers have the best possible chance to get a preferred tee time.

**A Note on Booking Bots:** Another modern challenge golf courses face is tee-time bots, which quickly scoop up desirable times for resale. While technology-based solutions like CAPTCHAs, IP address blocking, and bot detection services can be helpful in the short term, the people who program these bots are highly motivated and quickly find ways around new technology measures, leading to a never-ending game of cat and mouse. Courses have found that the simple financial requirements of prepayment or requiring a card-on-file act as a highly effective, persistent deterrent. Bots are programmed to exploit free or risk-free booking systems; requiring financial commitment makes the bot's task financially unfeasible, forcing them to move on to easier targets.
