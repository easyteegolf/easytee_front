We're thrilled to announce the launch of our most versatile feature yet, expanding Easy Tee Golf far beyond the fairway\!

For years, we've been the trusted partner for golf courses, making tee times simple and seamless. In 2024, we proudly extended that ease to **golf simulator bookings**. Now, we're taking a monumental leap forward: Easy Tee Golf can now manage the schedule for **anything** your facility offers\!

### **Our Dedication to Golf Remains Strong**

While we are expanding our capabilities, our **primary focus and commitment remain firmly rooted in the golf industry**. We developed this universal scheduling feature because we realized that the modern golf course is often much more than just a course. Many of our customers manage facilities that include racquet clubs, resorts, or rental equipment like carts and boats. Our goal is to provide a comprehensive solution so you can manage **all** your operational schedules—from your first tee time to your last pickleball court booking—within the platform you already trust. This is about supporting the complete needs of the golf facilities we serve.


### **Why the Change? Simply Put: You Asked\!**

Our mission has always been to simplify scheduling for you, and we heard loud and clear that your facility offers more than just golf. Whether you manage a sprawling resort, a community park, or a multi-sport complex, you have unique scheduling needs.

With this new feature, you can now manage **all** your bookable resources in one intuitive platform: **Easy Tee Golf.**

### **What Can You Schedule Now?**

The possibilities are endless\! Think of Easy Tee Golf as your facility's central scheduling hub. Here are just a few examples of the diverse offerings our customers can now manage:

* **Racquet Sports:** Easily book and manage slots for **tennis** and **pickleball courts**.  
* **Winter Activities:** Schedule appointments for **cross-country skiing** trail access or **snowmobile rentals**.  
* **Water Adventures:** Handle bookings for **boat rentals** or dock reservations.  
* **Beyond:** This feature is truly customizable\! If it needs a time slot, a recurring schedule, or a booking window, Easy Tee Golf can manage it. Think meeting rooms, equipment rentals, lessons, and more.

### **The Power of One Platform**

This update means less hassle and more streamlined operations for your staff and your customers.

* **Simplified Management:** Say goodbye to juggling multiple software platforms. Manage all your facility's resources—from your 18-hole course to your pickleball courts—under one Easy Tee Golf account.  
* **Seamless Customer Experience:** Your members and guests can now book all their favorite activities in one place, with the familiar, user-friendly interface they already love.  
* **Data Consistency:** Get a unified view of your facility's usage and revenue, making forecasting and planning easier than ever.
