As a golf course owner or manager, you know the frustration: a prime tee time gets cancelled at the last minute, and by the time you can react, it's too late to fill. That's lost revenue you can't get back, and a missed opportunity for a golfer eager to play. What if you could fill those unexpected openings?

At Easy Tee Golf, we're constantly working to provide you with the most effective tools to optimize your operations and maximize your revenue. That's why we're thrilled to announce the launch of our brand-new **Waitlist Feature\!**

### **How Our Waitlist Feature Transforms Your Tee Sheet**

Our new waitlist is designed to be a seamless, automated solution to a common problem. It bridges the gap between last-minute cancellations and eager golfers, ensuring your tee sheet stays as full as possible.

Here's how it works:

1. **Golfers Sign Up for Preferred Times:** When a desired tee time is already booked, golfers can now easily add themselves to a waitlist for that specific time or range of times. They simply indicate their preferred date, time, and group size.  
2. **Instant Notifications for Openings:** The moment a tee time becomes available due to a cancellation or change, our system automatically notifies all relevant golfers on the waitlist. This happens instantly, giving them the first opportunity to book the newly opened slot.  
3. **Quick and Easy Booking:** Notifications include a direct booking link, allowing golfers to book the available tee time with just a few clicks. This streamlined process means less administrative work for your staff and faster bookings for your customers.

### **The Benefits for Your Golf Course:**

* **Maximize Revenue:** Fill those last-minute openings that would otherwise go empty. Every filled tee time is direct revenue back into your course.  
* **Improve Golfer Satisfaction:** Your most dedicated customers will love the ability to grab those hard-to-get times, even when they're initially booked. It shows you're committed to getting them on the course.  
* **Reduce Administrative Burden:** Say goodbye to manual calls and frantic searches for replacements. Our automated system handles the heavy lifting, freeing up your staff to focus on other priorities.  
* **Optimize Tee Sheet Utilization:** Ensure every available slot on your tee sheet is generating revenue and contributing to a bustling course atmosphere.  
* **Combat No-Shows and Short-Shows (Even More\!):** While our cancellation policies and reporting help prevent no-shows, the waitlist acts as a powerful safety net, ensuring that even if one occurs, the slot can be quickly refilled.

### **See the Easy Tee Golf Waitlist in Action\!**

Imagine a scenario: A foursome cancels their 9 AM Saturday tee time at 10 PM on Friday. Historically, that slot might go unfilled. Now, with our waitlist, three different groups on the waitlist for a Saturday morning time instantly receive a notification. One of them books it within minutes. **Revenue saved, golfer made happy\!**
